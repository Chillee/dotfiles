# Alex Ozer's Dotfiles

This is where I share my dotfiles, with terrible commit messages that is.

Current setup:

My setup uses:
- Xfce for everything except the window manager and compositor
- Bspwm
- Compton
- Whiskermenu
- Gvim

I use GNU stow to symlink my dotfiles to my home directory like this:
```bash
stow $DIR
```
